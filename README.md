**haskell-interpreter**

The "haskell-interpreter" is a custom language interpreter developed using the Haskell programming language. Unlike traditional Haskell, which follows its well-defined syntax and semantics, this interpreter introduces its own syntax, enabling users to write code in a way that deviates from standard Haskell conventions. The primary goal of this project is to provide a platform for experimenting with and executing code using a unique syntax while harnessing the power of Haskell's capabilities.

**Key Features:**

1. **Custom Syntax**: The interpreter introduces a custom syntax that may differ from the standard Haskell syntax. This unique syntax allows users to write code that follows a set of rules specific to this interpreter.

2. **Basic Control Flow**: The interpreter includes basic control flow constructs such as for loops, while loops, and if-else conditions. Users can utilize these constructs to create structured and conditional logic in their programs.

3. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: To parse and interpret the custom syntax, the program relies on an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST serves as an internal representation of the code, making it easier to evaluate and execute user-defined scripts.

4. **Interactive REPL**: The interpreter provides an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment where users can enter code snippets, experiment with different constructs, and observe the results in real-time. This makes it an excellent tool for learning and rapid prototyping.

5. **Haskell Powered**: While the interpreter has its custom syntax, it leverages the underlying power of the Haskell programming language. Users can tap into Haskell's rich ecosystem of libraries and functions to perform a wide range of tasks within the interpreter.

6. **Extensible**: Depending on the design and implementation, the interpreter may be extensible, allowing users to define custom functions and extend its functionality to suit their specific needs.

7. **Educational Tool**: The "haskell-interpreter" can serve as an educational tool for individuals looking to explore programming languages, language design, or the fundamentals of interpreters. It provides insights into how a language interpreter can be built from scratch.

Overall, the "haskell-interpreter" project offers a unique and customizable environment for experimenting with code and control flow constructs. It bridges the gap between traditional Haskell and a custom syntax, making it a valuable resource for those interested in exploring alternative programming language paradigms and learning about interpreter development.
